## About Me
I'm a PhD Student at the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories (WACL), Universty of York. My research looks at modelling atmospheric composition over the UK using the open source, [GEOS-Chem](http://wiki.seas.harvard.edu/geos-chem/index.php/Main_Page) model. Most of my coding is done in [python](https://www.python.org/), but I'm also familiar with R and SQL, with a touch of FORTRAN. 

## My Research Highlights
In December 2020, I presented my work *"Predicting the effect of anthropogenic emission reductions due to COVID-19 restrictions with an atmospheric chemistry model"* at the [AGU 2020](https://www.agu.org/) conference. This used global emissions adjusted to account for national COVID-19 lockdown restrictions ([Forster at et al, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0883-0)) to estimate the changes in key atmospheric pollutants at the global and regional (United Kingdom) level.
